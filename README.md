# flutter_weather_clean_architecture

The concept of the project is [resocoder's clean architecture](https://resocoder.com/flutter-clean-architecture-tdd). This project is for learning purpose, that certainly follow [felangel's weather tutorial](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterweathertutorial), so that means the state managment using [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/).

## Difference

The main difference between [the original tutorial](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/flutterweathertutorial) with the project are the architecture and the api. Api use [open-meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) as our free weather api since the metaweather is no longer reachable for public. Architecture by my opinion, I prefer the structure of felangel's, but for learning purpose, I try clean architecture on this project.
